# Face Mask Detection - Model Evaluation PRD

## 1. Overview

This document outlines the evaluation phase for our Face Mask Detection project. Think of evaluation as the "final exam" for our AI models - we need to test how well they perform on completely new, unseen images.

### Why Evaluation Matters
- **Real-world performance**: Training accuracy might be misleading - we need to know how models perform on fresh data
- **Model comparison**: Which model is actually the best?
- **Deployment readiness**: Is the model good enough to use in real applications?

## 2. What We're Evaluating

We have **3 trained models** to evaluate:
1. **Custom CNN** (built from scratch)
2. **MobileNetV2** (transfer learning)
3. **ResNet50** (transfer learning)

Each model will be tested on our **test dataset** (992 images) that the models have never seen before.

## 3. Evaluation Metrics (Beginner-Friendly)

### 3.1 Basic Metrics

#### **Accuracy** 
- **What it means**: "How often is the model correct?"
- **Formula**: Correct predictions √∑ Total predictions
- **Example**: If model gets 990 out of 1000 right ‚Üí 99% accuracy
- **Why it matters**: Easy to understand overall performance

#### **Loss**
- **What it means**: "How confident is the model in its wrong answers?"
- **Lower is better**: Less loss = more confident in correct predictions
- **Why it matters**: Shows if model is "guessing" or truly confident

### 3.2 Advanced Metrics

#### **Confusion Matrix** (Think Like a Report Card)
Imagine you're a teacher grading a test where students identify "Mask" vs "No Mask":

**Real Example with 100 test images:**
```
                    What Model Predicted
                  Mask    No Mask
Real Answer Mask   85       5      = 90 people actually had masks
           No Mask  3       7      = 10 people actually had no masks
```

**Breaking it down:**
- **85**: Model correctly said "Mask" when person had mask ‚úÖ (True Positive)
- **7**: Model correctly said "No Mask" when person had no mask ‚úÖ (True Negative) 
- **5**: Model missed masks (said "No Mask" but person had mask) ‚ùå (False Negative)
- **3**: Model saw masks that weren't there (said "Mask" but no mask) ‚ùå (False Positive)

**Total Accuracy**: (85 + 7) √∑ 100 = 92%

#### **Precision**
- **What it means**: "When model says 'mask', how often is it right?"
- **Formula**: TP √∑ (TP + FP)
- **Example**: Model said "mask" 100 times, was right 95 times ‚Üí 95% precision

#### **Recall**
- **What it means**: "Of all actual masks, how many did we catch?"
- **Formula**: TP √∑ (TP + FN)
- **Example**: 100 people had masks, model found 90 ‚Üí 90% recall

#### **F1-Score**
- **What it means**: "Balance between precision and recall"
- **Formula**: 2 √ó (Precision √ó Recall) √∑ (Precision + Recall)
- **Why it matters**: Single number that considers both precision and recall

#### **Classification Report** (The Complete Report Card)
- **What it is**: A summary table that shows ALL the metrics above for each class
- **Think of it as**: A detailed report card that shows:
  - How well the model identifies masks
  - How well the model identifies no-masks  
  - Overall performance summary
- **Example output**:
  ```
                precision  recall  f1-score  support
  WithMask         0.96     0.94     0.95      450
  WithoutMask      0.95     0.97     0.96      542
  accuracy                          0.95      992
  ```
- **Should you add it?** YES! It's like getting a complete grade report instead of just a final grade

## 4. Evaluation Implementation (Single Phase)

### Phase 6: Model Evaluation & Comparison

```python
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import seaborn as sns
from sklearn.metrics import classification_report, confusion_matrix

# Step 1: Basic Performance Testing
print("=== Model Evaluation Results ===\n")

# Evaluate each model
cnn_loss, cnn_accuracy = cnn_model.evaluate(test_ds_cnn, verbose=0)
print(f"CNN Test Accuracy: {cnn_accuracy:.4f}")

mobilenet_loss, mobilenet_accuracy = mobilenet_model.evaluate(test_ds_mobilenet, verbose=0)  
print(f"MobileNetV2 Test Accuracy: {mobilenet_accuracy:.4f}")

resnet_loss, resnet_accuracy = resnet_model.evaluate(test_ds_resnet, verbose=0)
print(f"ResNet50 Test Accuracy: {resnet_accuracy:.4f}")

# Step 2: Get detailed predictions for analysis
cnn_predictions = cnn_model.predict(test_ds_cnn)
mobilenet_predictions = mobilenet_model.predict(test_ds_mobilenet)
resnet_predictions = resnet_model.predict(test_ds_resnet)

# Convert predictions to class labels
cnn_pred_classes = np.argmax(cnn_predictions, axis=1)
mobilenet_pred_classes = np.argmax(mobilenet_predictions, axis=1)
resnet_pred_classes = np.argmax(resnet_predictions, axis=1)

# Get true labels
true_labels = np.concatenate([y for x, y in test_ds_cnn], axis=0)

# Step 3: Classification Reports (Complete Report Cards)
class_names = ['WithMask', 'WithoutMask']

print("\n=== CNN Classification Report ===")
print(classification_report(true_labels, cnn_pred_classes, target_names=class_names))

print("\n=== MobileNetV2 Classification Report ===") 
print(classification_report(true_labels, mobilenet_pred_classes, target_names=class_names))

print("\n=== ResNet50 Classification Report ===")
print(classification_report(true_labels, resnet_pred_classes, target_names=class_names))

# Step 4: Confusion Matrices with Visualization
fig, axes = plt.subplots(1, 3, figsize=(15, 5))

models = ['CNN', 'MobileNetV2', 'ResNet50']
predictions = [cnn_pred_classes, mobilenet_pred_classes, resnet_pred_classes]

for i, (model, pred) in enumerate(zip(models, predictions)):
    cm = confusion_matrix(true_labels, pred)
    sns.heatmap(cm, annot=True, fmt='d', cmap='Blues', 
                xticklabels=class_names, yticklabels=class_names, ax=axes[i])
    axes[i].set_title(f'{model} Confusion Matrix')
    axes[i].set_xlabel('Predicted')
    axes[i].set_ylabel('Actual')

plt.tight_layout()
plt.show()

# Step 5: Model Comparison Summary
print("\n=== Final Model Comparison ===")
print(f"{'Model':<12} {'Accuracy':<10} {'Loss':<8}")
print("-" * 30)
print(f"{'CNN':<12} {cnn_accuracy:<10.4f} {cnn_loss:<8.4f}")
print(f"{'MobileNetV2':<12} {mobilenet_accuracy:<10.4f} {mobilenet_loss:<8.4f}")  
print(f"{'ResNet50':<12} {resnet_accuracy:<10.4f} {resnet_loss:<8.4f}")

# Determine best model
best_model = max([('CNN', cnn_accuracy), ('MobileNetV2', mobilenet_accuracy), 
                  ('ResNet50', resnet_accuracy)], key=lambda x: x[1])
print(f"\nüèÜ Best performing model: {best_model[0]} with {best_model[1]:.4f} accuracy")
```
