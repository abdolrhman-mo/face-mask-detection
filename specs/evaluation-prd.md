# Face Mask Detection - Model Evaluation PRD

## 1. Overview

This document outlines the evaluation phase for our Face Mask Detection project. Think of evaluation as the "final exam" for our AI models - we need to test how well they perform on completely new, unseen images.

### Why Evaluation Matters
- **Real-world performance**: Training accuracy might be misleading - we need to know how models perform on fresh data
- **Model comparison**: Which model is actually the best?
- **Deployment readiness**: Is the model good enough to use in real applications?

## 2. What We're Evaluating

We have **3 trained models** to evaluate:
1. **Custom CNN** (built from scratch)
2. **MobileNetV2** (transfer learning)
3. **ResNet50** (transfer learning)

Each model will be tested on our **test dataset** (992 images) that the models have never seen before.

## 3. Evaluation Metrics (Beginner-Friendly)

### 3.1 Basic Metrics

#### **Accuracy** 
- **What it means**: "How often is the model correct?"
- **Formula**: Correct predictions ÷ Total predictions
- **Example**: If model gets 990 out of 1000 right → 99% accuracy
- **Why it matters**: Easy to understand overall performance

#### **Loss**
- **What it means**: "How confident is the model in its wrong answers?"
- **Lower is better**: Less loss = more confident in correct predictions
- **Why it matters**: Shows if model is "guessing" or truly confident

### 3.2 Advanced Metrics

#### **Confusion Matrix**
- **What it means**: A 2x2 table showing exactly what the model got right/wrong
- **Structure**:
  ```
                  Predicted
                With  Without
  Actual With    TP     FN
         Without FP     TN
  ```
- **TP**: True Positive (correctly identified mask)
- **TN**: True Negative (correctly identified no mask)
- **FP**: False Positive (said mask when there wasn't one)
- **FN**: False Negative (missed a mask)

#### **Precision**
- **What it means**: "When model says 'mask', how often is it right?"
- **Formula**: TP ÷ (TP + FP)
- **Example**: Model said "mask" 100 times, was right 95 times → 95% precision

#### **Recall**
- **What it means**: "Of all actual masks, how many did we catch?"
- **Formula**: TP ÷ (TP + FN)
- **Example**: 100 people had masks, model found 90 → 90% recall

#### **F1-Score**
- **What it means**: "Balance between precision and recall"
- **Formula**: 2 × (Precision × Recall) ÷ (Precision + Recall)
- **Why it matters**: Single number that considers both precision and recall

## 4. Evaluation Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Basic Performance Testing
```python
# Test each model on unseen data
cnn_results = cnn_model.evaluate(test_ds_cnn)
mobilenet_results = mobilenet_model.evaluate(test_ds_mobilenet)
resnet_results = resnet_model.evaluate(test_ds_resnet)
```

### Phase 2: Detailed Predictions
```python
# Get predictions for detailed analysis
cnn_predictions = cnn_model.predict(test_ds_cnn)
mobilenet_predictions = mobilenet_model.predict(test_ds_mobilenet)
resnet_predictions = resnet_model.predict(test_ds_resnet)
```

### Phase 3: Classification Reports
```python
# Generate detailed metrics for each model
from sklearn.metrics import classification_report, confusion_matrix

# For each model, create:
# - Confusion matrix
# - Precision, Recall, F1-score per class
# - Overall accuracy
```

### Phase 4: Visualization
```python
# Create visual comparisons:
# - Confusion matrices as heatmaps
# - Bar charts comparing accuracies
# - Sample predictions (correct vs incorrect)
```

## 5. Model Comparison Framework

### 5.1 Performance Comparison Table

| Model | Test Accuracy | Test Loss | Precision | Recall | F1-Score | Training Time |
|-------|---------------|-----------|-----------|--------|----------|---------------|
| Custom CNN | TBD | TBD | TBD | TBD | TBD | ~Long |
| MobileNetV2 | TBD | TBD | TBD | TBD | TBD | ~Medium |
| ResNet50 | TBD | TBD | TBD | TBD | TBD | ~Long |

### 5.2 Comparison Criteria

#### **Accuracy** (Most Important)
- Which model gets the most predictions right?
- Target: >95% for real-world deployment

#### **Speed** (Real-world Deployment)
- **MobileNetV2**: Fastest (designed for mobile)
- **Custom CNN**: Medium speed
- **ResNet50**: Slowest but most powerful

#### **Model Size** (Storage/Memory)
- **Custom CNN**: Smallest
- **MobileNetV2**: Small-medium
- **ResNet50**: Largest

#### **Robustness** (Handling Edge Cases)
- Which model handles difficult cases best?
- Test with tricky images (sunglasses, partial masks, etc.)

### 5.3 Real-World Scenarios

#### **Scenario 1: Mobile App**
- **Best choice**: MobileNetV2 (fast, accurate, small)
- **Why**: Balance of performance and efficiency

#### **Scenario 2: Security System**
- **Best choice**: ResNet50 (highest accuracy)
- **Why**: Accuracy more important than speed

#### **Scenario 3: Edge Device**
- **Best choice**: Custom CNN (smallest, custom-tuned)
- **Why**: Limited resources, specific use case
